# Conformance tests

The tests Owly runs against [the spec](SPEC.md). Each one cites the requirements it covers, and `cargo xtask coverage` (part of `just ci`) checks that every in-scope MUST in `tests/coverage.toml` has a test citing it, directly or through a `T-*` ID below. A test cites what it checks with a comment such as `// spec: T-DISC-1` or `// spec: ASK-7, HTTP-3`.

Layers 3–7 can be tested without a radio, by running sender and receiver on the two ends of a veth pair in a user network namespace (`crates/owly-airdrop/tests/harness`). Unlike the loopback interface, that gives them link-local addresses, multicast for mDNS and `%iface` scoping (NET-2). Layers 1–2 need a capture or a phone.

Tests MUST NOT assume an identifier normalization for the BLE and record hashes, since the spec doesn't define one (BLE-4).

**Vectors.** `tests/vectors/airdrop-vectors.json` holds byte-level vectors for normal transfers, in the style of `identity-vectors.json`, and `tests/vectors/gen_airdrop_vectors.py` regenerates it. Every implementation's parsers and encoders SHOULD pass them. They are *reconstructed* from the message shapes the spec describes, not captured from Apple devices. Real captures from a Mac → iPhone transfer SHOULD be added when available, marked `"source": "capture"`.

| ID | Covers | Given / When / Then |
|---|---|---|
| T-MDNS-1 | MDNS-1, MDNS-5 | Given a running receiver, when browsing `_airdrop._tcp` on its interface, then exactly one instance with a 12-hex-digit name, an AAAA link-local address and a TXT `flags` with bit `0x04` or `0x08` set is found. Bit `0x02` is clear unless DVZip is implemented. |
| T-MDNS-2 | MDNS-7 | Given a receiver on a link whose radio asks for a burst of 3 copies 50 ms apart with a 3 s pause, when it stays visible for 7 s, then a listener on the link hears 3 announcements per burst, at least 3 bursts, and no fewer after the first. |
| T-DISC-1 | DISC-1, HTTP-3 | Given an Everyone-mode receiver, when `/Discover` is posted with `{}`, then the response is `200` with a bplist containing `ReceiverComputerName` and `StatusCode` `100`. |
| T-DISC-2 | DISC-2, ID-3 | Given a Contacts Only receiver with no matching contacts, when `/Discover` is posted with any record, then the response has `StatusCode` `401` and no `ReceiverComputerName`. |
| T-DISC-3 | DISC-3 | `ReceiverMediaCapabilities` decodes as UTF-8 JSON with integer `Version`. |
| T-DISC-4 | HTTP-2a, HTTP-3 | Every `discover` vector is accepted, with both chunked and `Content-Length` framing. |
| T-CONN-1 | HTTP-1, HTTP-7 | `/Discover` on connection A, then `/Ask` + `/Upload` on connection B, succeeds. `/Discover` then `/Ask` + `/Upload` on one connection also succeeds. |
| T-CONN-2 | HTTP-7 | A second `/Discover` on the same connection is rejected. |
| T-ASK-1 | ASK-1, ASK-3 | Given a receiver set to prompt, when the user declines, then `/Ask` returns non-200 and a following `/Upload` is rejected. |
| T-ASK-2 | ASK-2 | Given a receiver set to prompt, when nobody answers, then `/Ask` returns non-200 after 15 s (±1 s). |
| T-ASK-3 | ASK-4 | Given a link share, when `/Ask` returns 200, then the sender sends no `/Upload` and reports success. |
| T-ASK-4 | §6.4 | The receiver parses every `ask` vector, current and legacy forms, to the `expect` fields. |
| T-ASK-5 | ASK-7 | The sender's `/Ask` for a given file decodes to the current form: `TransferID` and `TransferType` dicts, `FileSize`, `./` `FileBomPath`, `ShouldConvertMediaFormats`, `Items: []`. |
| T-ASK-6 | ASK-2a | Given a receiver that never answers `/Ask`, the sender reports "declined" after its timeout, which is longer than 15 s. |
| T-UP-1 | UP-1, UP-1a, UP-2, UP-5 | Given an accepted `/Ask`, every `upload` vector extracts to its `expect` files, byte-identical, with response `200`. The vectors cover DVZip and gzip, `Content-Length` and chunked, odc with and without the `.` root entry, and `newc`. |
| T-UP-2 | UP-3 | When `/Upload` carries `Expect: 100-continue`, then `100 Continue` is sent before the body is read. |
| T-UP-3 | UP-4 | A content type other than `application/x-dvzip` or `application/x-cpio` → `406`. |
| T-UP-4 | UP-6 | `/Upload` with no prior accepted `/Ask`, or with the `/Ask` on a different connection → rejected, nothing written. |
| T-UP-5 | UP-8 | A pipelined `/Upload` sent before a declined `/Ask` is discarded and nothing is written. |
| T-UP-6 | UP-2, UP-2a | The sender's archive for each odc `cpio` vector's files decodes to the same entries, in the same order, with the same names, modes and data. |
| T-UP-7 | UP-9 | An `/Upload` whose `TransferID` header doesn't match its current-form `/Ask` → rejected, nothing written. A legacy `/Ask` followed by an `/Upload` with no `TransferID` header → accepted. |
| T-DVZ-1 | DVZ-1, DVZ-2 | Every `dvzip` vector decodes to its `expect` output (length and SHA-256). Encoding that output gives the same number of chunks and decodes back to it. Compressed bytes aren't compared, since zlib versions differ. |
| T-DVZ-2 | DVZ-1, DVZ-3 | A stream mixing zlib and stored chunks, as an iPhone sends a photo, decodes to the archive, fed whole or a byte at a time. A stored chunk past the limit, empty, or cut short is rejected. |
| T-HTTP-1 | HTTP-5, SEC-8 | `POST /X` with a 1-byte body → `400`, and the server keeps serving. |
| T-SEC-1 | SEC-1, UP-7 | Archives containing `../x`, `/etc/x`, a symlink or an entry not in `/Ask` → rejected, staging directory removed, destination untouched. |
| T-SEC-2 | SEC-3 | A 10 MB gzip expanding past the limit → rejected without filling the disk. |
| T-SEC-3 | SEC-6 | An XML plist, and a bplist nested 200 levels deep, posted to `/Discover` → rejected with an HTTP error, server keeps serving. |
| T-SEC-4 | SEC-7 | Duplicate conflicting `Content-Length`, chunk size `-1`, and `Content-Length` far past the body each → `400`, server keeps serving. |
| T-AWDL-1 | AWDL-3, AWDL-4, AWDL-5 | A parser fed captured iPhone PSFs and MIFs (including zero-padded ones) yields all TLVs without error. |
| T-AWDL-2 | AWDL-13 | A built data frame for a given IPv6 packet matches the golden bytes. |
| T-AWDL-3 | AWDL-7, AWDL-17 | Replaying a capture of a session (`tests/captures/`), a passive node finds the capture's peers valid, follows its master, and keeps within 3 TU of the master's schedule. |
| T-INTEROP-1 | all | iPhone → Linux photo, Linux → iPhone photo, Linux → iPhone link, each in Everyone mode. |
