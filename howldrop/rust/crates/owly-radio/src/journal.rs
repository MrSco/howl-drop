//! The recovery journal: each change a radio session makes to the kernel
//! and NetworkManager, recorded before it's made, in a file locked by the
//! process that owns the radio. Undoing a session replays it backwards, so
//! a session that died halfway, or a process killed outright, is undone
//! the same way as an orderly teardown: by whoever opens the journal next.
//!
//! The file is JSON, replaced whole on every change, and lives in the run
//! directory (`/run/owly/journal.json`), which outlives the process but not
//! a reboot, as the changes themselves don't.
