//! Availability windows (docs/SPEC.md §3.3).
//!
//! An availability window (AW) lasts 16 TU, and four make an extended one
//! (EAW), one slot of the channel sequence: 64 TU. A node counts AWs, and a
//! node that isn't the sync master aligns its count and phase to the
//! master's Synchronization Parameters TLV (AWDL-7). [`Clock`] keeps that
//! alignment.
